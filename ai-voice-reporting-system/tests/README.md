# Testing Strategy and Setup for AI-Powered Voice Reporting System

This README file outlines the testing strategy and setup for the AI-Powered Voice Reporting System project. It is essential to ensure that all components of the system function correctly and meet the specified requirements.

## Testing Overview

The testing strategy consists of several key components:

1. **Functional Testing**: 
   - Verify each component with unit tests and mocks.
   - Example: Test that uploading a sample PDF produces the correct summary text or that a given voice query produces the expected answer.

2. **Integration Testing**: 
   - Test end-to-end scenarios, such as uploading a report and then using the voice UI to ask questions about it.
   - Automate tests that stream a prerecorded question audio and check the audio response for key phrases.

3. **Accessibility Testing**: 
   - Use automated checkers (e.g., Lighthouse, Axe) on the UI.
   - Conduct manual testing with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure navigation and labels are correct.
   - Verify that audio outputs have matching text transcripts and that color contrast and font sizes meet WCAG standards.

4. **Performance Testing**: 
   - Measure latency of the full pipeline (audio-in â†’ response-out).
   - Use synthetic load tests to see when Cloud Run scales and track response times for STT, LLM inference, and TTS.
   - Optimize by using streaming APIs and possibly caching common queries.

5. **Security & Reliability Testing**: 
   - Verify that services authenticate properly (use service accounts/Secrets for API keys).
   - Ensure that audio data is transmitted securely (HTTPS/WSS).
   - Check error handling for bad inputs.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the testing environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. For Python, use `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`. For frontend, run `npm install` in the `frontend` directory.

2. **Run Tests**: 
   - For backend tests, navigate to the `tests/backend` directory and run the tests using a testing framework like `pytest`.
   - For frontend tests, navigate to the `tests/frontend` directory and run the tests using a testing framework like `Jest`.

3. **Accessibility Testing**: 
   - Use tools like WAVE or Axe to run automated accessibility checks on the frontend application.
   - Perform manual testing with screen readers to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

4. **Performance Testing**: 
   - Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate load and measure performance metrics.

5. **Review Test Results**: 
   - Analyze the results of the tests and address any issues that arise.

By following this testing strategy and setup, we can ensure that the AI-Powered Voice Reporting System is robust, accessible, and performs well under various conditions.
